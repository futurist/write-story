shall,ʃæl,"v. i. & auxiliary. To owe; to be under obligation for.\nv. i. & auxiliary. To be obliged; must.\nv. i. & auxiliary. As an auxiliary, shall indicates a duty or\n   necessity whose obligation is derived from the person speaking; as, you\n   shall go; he shall go; that is, I order or promise your going. It thus\n   ordinarily expresses, in the second and third persons, a command, a\n   threat, or a promise. If the auxillary be emphasized, the command is\n   made more imperative, the promise or that more positive and sure. It is\n   also employed in the language of prophecy; as, ""the day shall come when\n   . . . , "" since a promise or threat and an authoritative prophecy\n   nearly coincide in significance. In shall with the first person, the\n   necessity of the action is sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than\n   in the speaker; as, I shall suffer; we shall see; and there is always a\n   less distinct and positive assertion of his volition than is indicated\n   by will. ""I shall go"" implies nearly a simple futurity; more exactly, a\n   foretelling or an expectation of my going, in which, naturally enough,\n   a certain degree of plan or intention may be included; emphasize the\n   shall, and the event is described as certain to occur, and the\n   expression approximates in meaning to our emphatic ""I will go."" In a\n   question, the relation of speaker and source of obligation is of course\n   transferred to the person addressed; as, ""Shall you go?"" (answer, ""I\n   shall go""); ""Shall he go?"" i. e., ""Do you require or promise his\n   going?"" (answer, ""He shall go"".) The same relation is transferred to\n   either second or third person in such phrases as ""You say, or think,\n   you shall go;"" ""He says, or thinks, he shall go."" After a conditional\n   conjunction (as if, whether) shall is used in all persons to express\n   futurity simply; as, if I, you, or he shall say they are right. Should\n   is everywhere used in the same connection and the same senses as shall,\n   as its imperfect. It also expresses duty or moral obligation; as, he\n   should do it whether he will or not. In the early English, and hence in\n   our English Bible, shall is the auxiliary mainly used, in all the\n   persons, to express simple futurity. (Cf. Will, v. t.) Shall may be\n   used elliptically; thus, with an adverb or other word expressive of\n   motion go may be omitted.",aux. 将,,4,1,zk gk,474,2197,,,

to,tu:,"prep. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,\n   motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,\n   access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement toward;\n   -- opposed to from.\nprep. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a\n   time, a state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being\n   regarded as a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going\n   to a trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.\nprep. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of\n   application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or\n   indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs\n   with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges upon\n   that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or appropriation;\n   as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us keep this\n   seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful to\n   the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous\n   liquor.\nprep. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last\n   defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it\n   as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to\n   go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do my\n   utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost\n   constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it has no\n   prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct object or\n   subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to die for one's\n   country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country. Where the\n   infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage formerly allowed\n   the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out for see? (Matt.\n   xi. 8).\nprep. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to\n   has a pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically.\nprep. Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as;\n   as, they met us to the number of three hundred.\nprep. Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to\n   his ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to\n   the prejudice of the state.\nprep. Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they\n   engaged hand to hand.\nprep. Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has\n   a husband to her mind.\nprep. Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven;\n   it is ten to one that you will offend him.\nprep. Addition; union; accumulation.\nprep. Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced to\n   the music of a piano.\nprep.
